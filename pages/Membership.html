                        <h2>West Fork Church Membership</h2>
                            <p>
                                Although other congregations have an official membership roll, at this time in the life of WFF we do not have an official membership or membership process. There are no ‘official’ church membership requirements at WFF as the scriptures do not specifically dictate that as a command. However, we consider those who are continuing with us in serving and attending regularly, by doing so, are outwardly proclaiming they are a part of the local body of Christ at WFF. They are under the privileges and responsibilities as set forth in the scriptures for all New Testament Churches. The Elders of WFF will still speak with you concerning your testimony, your commitment to Jesus Christ, to His Bride (to WFF), and of our commitment as a Church family to you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We do not have an official ‘Church covenant of commitment’ among the members, but we do anticipate and expect those who enter into the life and ministry of WFF to live a life, to the best of their ability – by the power of the Holy Spirit. A life that is committed to honoring the Lord and living out His truths in such a way, that God is glorified and others around them are impacted by the Gospel of Jesus Christ through their daily lives.
                            </p>
