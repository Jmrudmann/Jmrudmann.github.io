                        <p>
                            The purpose of West Fork Fellowship is to glorify God by obediently making and equipping disciples of Jesus Christ in Fairmont, 
                            and throughout the world, by the power of the Holy Spirit. We purpose to inform your mind and inspire your heart to know Christ, 
                            to love Him, to suffer with Him, and to serve people for His glory. Our heart is for the glory of God and the benefit of our fellow man. 
                
                        </p>
                
                        <h2>The Glory of God </h2>
                        <p>
                            Our first major goal as a local Church is the glory of God. Our greatest concern is that His Name be great among the nations, 
                            from the rising to the setting of the sun (Malachi 1:11, 3:10), and that the Lamb who was slain might receive the full reward for His 
                            sufferings (Revelation 7:9-10). We find our great purpose and motivation, not in man or his needs, but in God, His commitment to His own glory, 
                            and our God-given desire to see Him worshipped in every nation, tribe, people, and language. We find our great confidence not in the 
                            Church’s ability to fulfill the Great Commission both locally and foreign, but in God’s unlimited and unhindered power to accomplish 
                            all He has decreed. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>The Benefit of Man </h2>
                        <p>
                            Our second major goal as a local Church is the salvation of a lost and dying humanity. The Christian who is truly passionate about the glory 
                            of God and confident in His sovereignty will not be unmoved by the billions of people in the world who have yet to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
                            If we are truly Christ-like, the lost multitude of humanity will move us to compassion (Matthew 9:36), even to great sorrow and unceasing grief 
                            (Romans 9:2). The sincerity of our Christian confession should be questioned if we are not willing to do all within our means to make Christ known 
                            among the nations and to endure all things for the sake of God’s elect (II Timothy 2:10). We are a people who are sorrowful, yet always rejoicing 
                            (2 Cor. 6:10). 
                        </p>
                
                        <h2>Why the name West Fork Fellowship?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Why West Fork? We are simply located very close to the West Fork River. 
                            Why Fellowship?  We feel the New Testament Church speaks strongly concerning the true meaning of the word fellowship and the command to practice it.  
                            We strive to create an atmosphere of genuine fellowship, not only on Sunday mornings, but throughout the week as well.  
                            The very first account of the New Testament Church highlights the importance of true biblical fellowship in Acts 2:42.  
                            They were devoted to the Apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer.  
                            We believe the professing church has lessened the idea of what true biblical fellowship and hospitality looks like.  
                            The very definition of fellowship is to have a partnership and to participate with one another.    
                            The word ‘fellowship’ at its core means to share all things in common.  Fellowship is holy companionship.  
                            It’s the true essence of a family of Believers, it’s relationships and partnerships with one another as we serve and commune with Christ together.
                            
                            We are a none-denominational fellowship of believers with two main goals: Those two goals are for the glory of God and for the benefit of man.
