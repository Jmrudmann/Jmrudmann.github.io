                            <p>
                                We are a small non-denominational fellowship of local Believers who gather at various times throughout the week to learn about Christ, worship, 
                                fellowship together, and serve our community. On a typical Sunday, you will see some people in jeans, some in suits, some in dresses. 
                                Come as you are, but whether you’re formal or informal, modesty is encouraged. We are a simple congregation and encourage you to keep your children 
                                with you during our service time. Little ears can hear big truths too. West Fork Fellowship is centered on the preaching of God's Word. 
                                Worship through singing also takes place as a complement to the preaching of the Word. The preaching style is called, expositional preaching. 
                                In other words, we go verse by verse through a passage or book of the Bible. This allows us to soak up the details, as well as the overall meaning 
                                and context of the passage. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Congregational Worship</h2>
                            <p>
                                The church assembles on Sunday to be strengthened by the preaching of the Word and fellowship, to reinforce our faith through song, to encourage one another by testimonies, and to express congregational praise and worship to Christ, who is our Audience. The primary focus in our singing is the truth of the Word of God and the edification of the Saints. 

                                We also practice the two ordinances commanded and practiced by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. We practice open communion which means if you are a professing believer who is visiting with us and in right standing with God, you may join us in fellowship through communion. 
                                
                                We also practice the ordinance of Believers baptism by immersion when applicable. 
                            </p>
